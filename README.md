# autopwn-ng
Because bash is the future

Tests default credentials on SSH and RDP servers at ISUCDCs. pulls down blue team flags on ssh servers as well.

## Usage
./autopwn.sh

there's no switches or input files yet so it has credentials/servernames/flag locations hard coded in.

## TODO
	- plant red flags
	- try users other than root/administrator
	- possibly script some windows commands
	- make RDP multiprocess like SSH is
	- debug other things that will arise after actually running this once
	- scrape iseage for hostnames
